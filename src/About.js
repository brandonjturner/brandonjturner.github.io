              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Brandon Turner and I have been interested in computers since I was a child using old parts from my Fathers work as toys. I started building my own computers when I was 12 and got into video editing shortly after. From video editing I got into 2D effects then to 3D effects. After that I got into web development creating my first working page in 2003. I sold my first website in 2004 and from then on I was hooked.
